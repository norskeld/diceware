Rust crate and CLI for generating strong [Diceware] passphrases.

## Installation

### macOS Intel (Homebrew)

```shell
brew tap norskeld/tap
brew install norskeld/tap/diceware
```

### macOS / Linux / Windows (Cargo)

Make sure to [install Rust toolchain][rust-toolchain] first. After that you can install Diceware via **Cargo**:

```shell
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/norskeld/diceware
```

## CLI usage

As of now you can install it globally via **cargo** (assuming you have cargo and rustc installed):

```shell
cargo install --git https://github.com/norskeld/diceware
```

Just invoke `diceware --help`. It's really simple.

```shell
diceware 0.1.2
Generates strong Diceware passphrases.

USAGE:
    diceware [OPTIONS]

OPTIONS:
    -l, --length <LENGTH>        How much words you want to generate [default: 6]
    -w, --wordlist <WORDLIST>    Path to a custom wordlist
    -e, --entropy                Show entropy of the passphrase
    -h, --help                   Print help information
    -V, --version                Print version information
```

## Example of output

```shell
$ diceware --entropy

probation overdraft debtor ground nintendo sculptor

Possibilities: 7776
Entropy: 77.55 bits

```

## Crate usage

You can use this crate as a git dependency:

```toml
[dependencies]
diceware = { git = "https://github.com/norskeld/diceware" }
```

## Notes

By default CLI uses the [EFF long wordlist][eff-long-wordlist], which is a little bit better than the one original one.

## Diceware

In short, passphrases are generated by "throwing" a dice five times, joining the numbers into one, and then looking up for the word with the corresponding number in the wordlist. This process repeats N times (default is **6**) until all words are found. You can find more information about that technique on [the official Diceware page][diceware-official] or on [the Diceware FAQ page][diceware-faq].
