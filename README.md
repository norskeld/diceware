Rust crate and CLI for generating strong [Diceware] passphrases.

## Diceware

In short, passphrases are generated by "throwing" a dice five times, joining the numbers into one, and then looking up for the word with the corresponding number in the wordlist. This process repeats N times (default is **6**) until all words are found. You can find more information about that technique on [the official Diceware page][diceware-official] or on [the Diceware FAQ page][diceware-faq].
